> CAP: Consistency, Available, Partition

## Consistency patterns
### Weak Consistency
- Real time
- Lost data during connection loss

### Eventual Consistency
- Write => Read
- Data is replicated asynchronously
- In highly available systems

### Strong Consistency
- Data is replicated synchronously
- File system & RDBMS
- Transactions

## Consistency Model
### Backups
-   Make a copy
-   Sledgehammer
-   Weak consistency
-   Usually no transactions
-   Datastore: early internal launch

### Master/Slave replication
-   Usually asynchronous
-   Good for throughput, latency
-   Most RDBMSes
	-   e.g. MySQL binary logs
-   Weak/eventual consistency
	-   Granularity matters!
-   Datastore: current

### Multi-master replication
-   Umbrella term for merging concurrent writes
-   Asynchronous, eventual consistency
-   Need _serialization_ protocol
	-   e.g. _timestamp oracle_: monotonically increasing timestamps
	-   Either SPOF with master election...
	-   ...or distributed consensus protocol
-   No global transactions!
-   Datastore: no strong consistency

### Two Phase Commit
-   Semi-distributed consensus protocol
	-   deterministic coordinator
-   1: propose, 2: vote, 3: commit/abort
-   Heavyweight, synchronous, high latency
-   3PC buys async with extra round trip
-   Datastore: poor throughput

### Paxos
-   Fully distributed consensus protocol
-   "Either Paxos, or Paxos with cruft, or broken"
	-   Mike Burrows
-   Majority writes; survives minority failure
-   Protocol similar to 2PC/3PC
	-   Lighter, but still high latency

## Availability Patterns
### Fail-over
#### Active-passive
With active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby.

#### Active-active
Both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.

### Replication
**Master-slave and master-master**
